What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For this assignment, it took me a while to fully understand the instruction. Because I did not fully understand it in the first place, I wrote versions of code and then delete them all because they are not following the guidelines. The advice will be make sure to understand the README before getting started. However, the two python files help me to practice the skills of building attributes, constructor, methods, and main function. Some advice will be to make sure to start the homework earlier, so we have enough time to make mistake and fix them.
